# Facial_Keypoint_Detection_ImageRegression
Detecting the center of the eyes in the images using Deep Learning. Used VGG16 'imagenet' weights for preprocessing and extraction of features and sent that into a dense layer to get coordinates of the target using linear activation function. (Image Regression problem)
